SYSTEMINFO
[Website](https://superuser.com/questions/1022381/using-systeminfo-command-on-network-computer)
The SuperUser post discusses how to use the `systeminfo` command to retrieve system details from a remote computer on a network. It explains that you can run the command with the `/s` parameter followed by the remote computer's name or IP address. However, proper credentials (username and password) are required, and administrative privileges may be necessary. The post also mentions potential issues, such as access restrictions and firewall settings that might block remote queries.

The StackOverflow post discusses how to use the `find` command in CMD to search for multiple lines of text in a file. Since `find` can only search for one string at a time, a workaround is using multiple `find` commands with piping (`|`) or combining them in a batch script. An alternative is using `findstr`, which allows searching for multiple strings simultaneously by separating them with spaces or using a file input.
